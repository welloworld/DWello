As a Digital Whisper big fan, I decided to create a tool for give me the exact information I want.
I will add any feature that I'll have on my mind in the moment I will have time, but if you can/want to help me - you more than welcome to fork & PR.
All rights reserved to Digital Whisper site, founders and articles writers.

Feature list:
* Download articles (all, specific, range)
* Download issues (all, specific, range, last one)
* Easy CLI for running options
* Get all article writers
* Get articles by specific writer
* Count pages per issue/article
* PDF parsing? e.g. statistics about counting specific words, 
* Mail me when an issue released
* Login & Register
* Read & Write comments
* clean folder

Currently contains:
* Get the data from articles, parsing and get the date, author, issue number, link and article name for each article.
* Saving all the data in an output file, currently saving only authors, but can be changed easily as decribed.

More than welcome to send me any idea/issue to wellosworld@gmail.com
